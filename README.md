# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

Play a simple 5 round match of Rock, Paper, Scissors 

This Game is a small project for the foundations course in TheOdinProject.

The goal was to create a function that generates either rock paper or scissors, then create another function that prompts the user to choose the same and record the score of the winner for 5 rounds.
